# Capstone Project at the Georgia Higher Education Healthcare Initiative

### Summary

The Georgia Higher Education Healthcare Initiative aims to generate ideas and action plans to significantly improve Georgia’s standing and the number of RNs and MDs who practice in the state. We will accomplish this by offering a path for collaboration to improve the state’s healthcare workforce. We will outline a set of feasible, meaningful collaborative action steps across healthcare, academia, and communities to strengthen our state’s capacity to help Georgians get and stay healthy. We are sponsored by our benefactor James (Jim) M. Hull of Augusta, Georgia. Jim serves on the Board of Regents for the University System of Georgia.

### Data and Tools

We are using Hospital Cost Reports that contain provider information such as facility characteristics, utilization data, cost and charges by cost center (in total and for Medicare), Medicare settlement data, and financial statement data. We have every Hospital Cost Report for each hospital in the country since 2013. The format of this data is a relational database composed of three .csv files with millions of records in each file. I will be using R and R Studio to produce the Capstone Project code and final report. I will also use Power BI to display the data in visualizations easily interpreted by the public.
